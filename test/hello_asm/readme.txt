Hello_asm -- displays a 'hello' greeting message on the serial port.

In order to make this demo, you need the free assembler ASEM51.

Running `build all` will build the program and create an intel hex file, a 
listing file and a vhdl file that you can use to initialize a ROM for simulation
or for synthesis.

Please use the makefile in /sim/ghdl to run this example on a vhdl simularion OR
on a software ISS.
