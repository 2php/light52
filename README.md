Yet another free 8051 FPGA core.

## Status

This project is in a very early state: 

* No documentation other than this readme file and a draft of the datasheet.
* Hardly debugged.

The design and most of the implementation is done.
The core has already passed a basic test bench and executed a 'Hello World' demo
on actual hardware. Yet, there are still many loose ends and a strong test bench 
has yet to be developed -- bugs are known to remain.

I am now incrementally improving the test bench code, catching and fixing bugs 
until the test bench is strong enough. The next step will then be adding some 
synthesizable demos and a benchmark.  


Anyway, until some real documentation is added explaining how to set up and use this
project, you are advised to just ignore it.

(This repo would be private if GitHub free accounts supported that feature).
