Yet another free 8051 FPGA core.

## Status

This project is in a very early state: 

* No documentation other than this readme file.
* Hardly debugged.
* No useable synthesizable demo.

Until some real documentation is added you are advised to just ignore this project.  

(This repo would be private if GitHub free accounts supported that feature).
